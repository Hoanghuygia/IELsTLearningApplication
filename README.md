# IELTS Learning Application  

## Description  
A mobile application that helps users learn English through practical IELTS examinations with an AI chatbot and other features like saving words, highlighting words, etc.  

---

## I. Backend  
- Using **Node.js** and **Express.js** to handle APIs with middleware and connect with **MongoDB Atlas**.  
- Using **Railway** to deploy.  
- Handling **Google OAuth** to access Google API with **Supabase** and security.  

---

## II. Frontend  
- Using **Jetpack Compose** â€“ a modern toolkit for building native Android applications.  
- Fetching API using **OkHttpClient** and **Retrofit**.  
- Using **Dagger Hilt** for automatic dependency injection.  
- Saving local data using **DataStore** instead of SharedPreferences.

## Note  
Due to some critical points, I need to refactor the frontend side.
